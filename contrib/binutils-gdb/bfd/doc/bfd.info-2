2.14 Opening and closing BFDs
=============================

2.14.1 Functions for opening and closing
----------------------------------------

2.14.1.1 'bfd_fopen'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fopen (const char *filename, const char *target,
         const char *mode, int fd);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME with the target TARGET.  Return a pointer to the
created BFD. If FD is not -1, then 'fdopen' is used to open the file;
otherwise, 'fopen' is used.  MODE is passed directly to 'fopen' or
'fdopen'.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   The new BFD is marked as cacheable iff FD is -1.

   If 'NULL' is returned then an error has occured.  Possible errors are
'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target' or 'system_call'
error.

   On error, FD is always closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.2 'bfd_openr'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME (using 'fopen') with the target TARGET.  Return a
pointer to the created BFD.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   If 'NULL' is returned then an error has occured.  Possible errors are
'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target' or 'system_call'
error.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.3 'bfd_fdopenr'
......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fdopenr (const char *filename, const char *target, int fd);
   *Description*
'bfd_fdopenr' is to 'bfd_fopenr' much like 'fdopen' is to 'fopen'.  It
opens a BFD on a file already described by the FD supplied.

   When the file is later 'bfd_close'd, the file descriptor will be
closed.  If the caller desires that this file descriptor be cached by
BFD (opened as needed, closed as needed to free descriptors for other
opens), with the supplied FD used as an initial file descriptor (but
subject to closure at any time), call bfd_set_cacheable(bfd, 1) on the
returned BFD. The default is to assume no caching; the file descriptor
will remain open until 'bfd_close', and will not be affected by BFD
operations on other files.

   Possible errors are 'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target'
and 'bfd_error_system_call'.

   On error, FD is closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.4 'bfd_openstreamr'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openstreamr (const char * filename, const char * target, void * stream);
   *Description*
Open a BFD for read access on an existing stdio stream.  When the BFD is
passed to 'bfd_close', the stream will be closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.5 'bfd_openr_iovec'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_iovec (const char *filename, const char *target,
         void *(*open_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *open_closure),
         void *open_closure,
         file_ptr (*pread_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream,
         void *buf,
         file_ptr nbytes,
         file_ptr offset),
         int (*close_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream),
         int (*stat_func) (struct bfd *abfd,
         void *stream,
         struct stat *sb));
   *Description*
Create and return a BFD backed by a read-only STREAM.  The STREAM is
created using OPEN_FUNC, accessed using PREAD_FUNC and destroyed using
CLOSE_FUNC.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   Calls OPEN_FUNC (which can call 'bfd_zalloc' and 'bfd_get_filename')
to obtain the read-only stream backing the BFD. OPEN_FUNC either
succeeds returning the non-'NULL' STREAM, or fails returning 'NULL'
(setting 'bfd_error').

   Calls PREAD_FUNC to request NBYTES of data from STREAM starting at
OFFSET (e.g., via a call to 'bfd_read').  PREAD_FUNC either succeeds
returning the number of bytes read (which can be less than NBYTES when
end-of-file), or fails returning -1 (setting 'bfd_error').

   Calls CLOSE_FUNC when the BFD is later closed using 'bfd_close'.
CLOSE_FUNC either succeeds returning 0, or fails returning -1 (setting
'bfd_error').

   Calls STAT_FUNC to fill in a stat structure for bfd_stat,
bfd_get_size, and bfd_get_mtime calls.  STAT_FUNC returns 0 on success,
or returns -1 on failure (setting 'bfd_error').

   If 'bfd_openr_iovec' returns 'NULL' then an error has occurred.
Possible errors are 'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target'
and 'bfd_error_system_call'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.6 'bfd_openw'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openw (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
Create a BFD, associated with file FILENAME, using the file format
TARGET, and return a pointer to it.

   Possible errors are 'bfd_error_system_call', 'bfd_error_no_memory',
'bfd_error_invalid_target'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.7 'bfd_close'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. If the BFD was open for writing, then pending operations
are completed and the file written out and closed.  If the created file
is executable, then 'chmod' is called to mark it as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   The file descriptor associated with the BFD is closed (even if it was
passed in to BFD by 'bfd_fdopenr').

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.8 'bfd_close_all_done'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_close_all_done (bfd *);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. Differs from 'bfd_close' since it does not complete any
pending operations.  This routine would be used if the application had
just used BFD for swapping and didn't want to use any of the writing
code.

   If the created file is executable, then 'chmod' is called to mark it
as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.9 'bfd_create'
.....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_create (const char *filename, bfd *templ);
   *Description*
Create a new BFD in the manner of 'bfd_openw', but without opening a
file.  The new BFD takes the target from the target used by TEMPL.  The
format is always set to 'bfd_object'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.10 'bfd_make_writable'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_make_writable (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD as created by 'bfd_create' and converts it into one like as
returned by 'bfd_openw'.  It does this by converting the BFD to
BFD_IN_MEMORY. It's assumed that you will call 'bfd_make_readable' on
this bfd later.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.11 'bfd_make_readable'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_make_readable (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD as created by 'bfd_create' and 'bfd_make_writable' and
converts it into one like as returned by 'bfd_openr'.  It does this by
writing the contents out to the memory buffer, then reversing the
direction.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.12 'bfd_alloc'
.....................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_alloc (bfd *abfd, bfd_size_type wanted);
   *Description*
Allocate a block of WANTED bytes of memory attached to 'abfd' and return
a pointer to it.

2.14.1.13 'bfd_alloc2'
......................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_alloc2 (bfd *abfd, bfd_size_type nmemb, bfd_size_type size);
   *Description*
Allocate a block of NMEMB elements of SIZE bytes each of memory attached
to 'abfd' and return a pointer to it.

2.14.1.14 'bfd_zalloc'
......................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_zalloc (bfd *abfd, bfd_size_type wanted);
   *Description*
Allocate a block of WANTED bytes of zeroed memory attached to 'abfd' and
return a pointer to it.

2.14.1.15 'bfd_zalloc2'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_zalloc2 (bfd *abfd, bfd_size_type nmemb, bfd_size_type size);
   *Description*
Allocate a block of NMEMB elements of SIZE bytes each of zeroed memory
attached to 'abfd' and return a pointer to it.

2.14.1.16 'bfd_calc_gnu_debuglink_crc32'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned long bfd_calc_gnu_debuglink_crc32
        (unsigned long crc, const unsigned char *buf, bfd_size_type len);
   *Description*
Computes a CRC value as used in the .gnu_debuglink section.  Advances
the previously computed CRC value by computing and adding in the crc32
for LEN bytes of BUF.

   *Returns*
Return the updated CRC32 value.

2.14.1.17 'bfd_get_debug_link_info'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_get_debug_link_info (bfd *abfd, unsigned long *crc32_out);
   *Description*
Fetch the filename and CRC32 value for any separate debuginfo associated
with ABFD.  Return NULL if no such info found, otherwise return filename
and update CRC32_OUT.  The returned filename is allocated with 'malloc';
freeing it is the responsibility of the caller.

2.14.1.18 'bfd_get_alt_debug_link_info'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_get_alt_debug_link_info (bfd * abfd,
         bfd_size_type *buildid_len,
         bfd_byte **buildid_out);
   *Description*
Fetch the filename and BuildID value for any alternate debuginfo
associated with ABFD.  Return NULL if no such info found, otherwise
return filename and update BUILDID_LEN and BUILDID_OUT.  The returned
filename and build_id are allocated with 'malloc'; freeing them is the
responsibility of the caller.

2.14.1.19 'separate_debug_file_exists'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean separate_debug_file_exists
        (char *name, unsigned long crc32);
   *Description*
Checks to see if NAME is a file and if its contents match CRC32.

2.14.1.20 'separate_alt_debug_file_exists'
..........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean separate_alt_debug_file_exists
        (char *name, unsigned long crc32);
   *Description*
Checks to see if NAME is a file and if its BuildID matches BUILDID.

2.14.1.21 'find_separate_debug_file'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     char *find_separate_debug_file (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Searches ABFD for a section called SECTION_NAME which is expected to
contain a reference to a file containing separate debugging information.
The function scans various locations in the filesystem, including the
file tree rooted at DEBUG_FILE_DIRECTORY, and returns the first matching
filename that it finds.  If CHECK_CRC is TRUE then the contents of the
file must also match the CRC value contained in SECTION_NAME.  Returns
NULL if no valid file could be found.

2.14.1.22 'bfd_follow_gnu_debuglink'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_gnu_debuglink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debuglink section.  If this
section is found, it examines the section for the name and checksum of a
'.debug' file containing auxiliary debugging information.  It then
searches the filesystem for this .debug file in some standard locations,
including the directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found returns the
full filename.

   If DIR is NULL, it will search a default path configured into libbfd
at build time.  [XXX this feature is not currently implemented].

   *Returns*
'NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the .debug file, otherwise a
pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the filename.  The caller
is responsible for freeing this string.

2.14.1.23 'bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debugaltlink section.  If this
section is found, it examines the section for the name of a file
containing auxiliary debugging information.  It then searches the
filesystem for this file in a set of standard locations, including the
directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found returns the full filename.

   If DIR is NULL, it will search a default path configured into libbfd
at build time.  [FIXME: This feature is not currently implemented].

   *Returns*
'NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the debug file, otherwise a
pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the filename.  The caller
is responsible for freeing this string.

2.14.1.24 'bfd_create_gnu_debuglink_section'
............................................

*Synopsis*
     struct bfd_section *bfd_create_gnu_debuglink_section
        (bfd *abfd, const char *filename);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and adds a .gnu_debuglink section to it.  The section is
sized to be big enough to contain a link to the specified FILENAME.

   *Returns*
A pointer to the new section is returned if all is ok.  Otherwise 'NULL'
is returned and bfd_error is set.

2.14.1.25 'bfd_fill_in_gnu_debuglink_section'
.............................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_fill_in_gnu_debuglink_section
        (bfd *abfd, struct bfd_section *sect, const char *filename);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and containing a .gnu_debuglink section SECT and fills in
the contents of the section to contain a link to the specified FILENAME.
The filename should be relative to the current directory.

   *Returns*

2.15 Implementation details
===========================

2.15.1 Internal functions
-------------------------

*Description*
These routines are used within BFD. They are not intended for export,
but are documented here for completeness.

2.15.1.1 'bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int (bfd *, unsigned int);
   *Description*
Write a 4 byte integer I to the output BFD ABFD, in big endian order
regardless of what else is going on.  This is useful in archives.

2.15.1.2 'bfd_put_size'
.......................

2.15.1.3 'bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Description*
These macros as used for reading and writing raw data in sections; each
access (except for bytes) is vectored through the target format of the
BFD and mangled accordingly.  The mangling performs any necessary endian
translations and removes alignment restrictions.  Note that types
accepted and returned by these macros are identical so they can be
swapped around in macros--for example, 'libaout.h' defines 'GET_WORD' to
either 'bfd_get_32' or 'bfd_get_64'.

   In the put routines, VAL must be a 'bfd_vma'.  If we are on a system
without prototypes, the caller is responsible for making sure that is
true, with a cast if necessary.  We don't cast them in the macro
definitions because that would prevent 'lint' or 'gcc -Wall' from
detecting sins such as passing a pointer.  To detect calling these with
less than a 'bfd_vma', use 'gcc -Wconversion' on a host with 64 bit
'bfd_vma''s.

2.15.1.4 'bfd_h_put_size'
.........................

*Description*
These macros have the same function as their 'bfd_get_x' brethren,
except that they are used for removing information for the header
records of object files.  Believe it or not, some object files keep
their header records in big endian order and their data in little endian
order.

2.16 File caching
=================

The file caching mechanism is embedded within BFD and allows the
application to open as many BFDs as it wants without regard to the
underlying operating system's file descriptor limit (often as low as 20
open files).  The module in 'cache.c' maintains a least recently used
list of 'bfd_cache_max_open' files, and exports the name
'bfd_cache_lookup', which runs around and makes sure that the required
BFD is open.  If not, then it chooses a file to close, closes it and
opens the one wanted, returning its file handle.

2.17 Linker Functions
=====================

The linker uses three special entry points in the BFD target vector.  It
is not necessary to write special routines for these entry points when
creating a new BFD back end, since generic versions are provided.
However, writing them can speed up linking and make it use significantly
less runtime memory.

   The first routine creates a hash table used by the other routines.
The second routine adds the symbols from an object file to the hash
table.  The third routine takes all the object files and links them
together to create the output file.  These routines are designed so that
the linker proper does not need to know anything about the symbols in
the object files that it is linking.  The linker merely arranges the
sections as directed by the linker script and lets BFD handle the
details of symbols and relocs.

   The second routine and third routines are passed a pointer to a
'struct bfd_link_info' structure (defined in 'bfdlink.h') which holds
information relevant to the link, including the linker hash table (which
was created by the first routine) and a set of callback functions to the
linker proper.

   The generic linker routines are in 'linker.c', and use the header
file 'genlink.h'.  As of this writing, the only back ends which have
implemented versions of these routines are a.out (in 'aoutx.h') and
ECOFF (in 'ecoff.c').  The a.out routines are used as examples
throughout this section.

2.17.1 Creating a linker hash table
-----------------------------------

The linker routines must create a hash table, which must be derived from
'struct bfd_link_hash_table' described in 'bfdlink.c'.  *Note Hash
Tables::, for information on how to create a derived hash table.  This
entry point is called using the target vector of the linker output file.

   The '_bfd_link_hash_table_create' entry point must allocate and
initialize an instance of the desired hash table.  If the back end does
not require any additional information to be stored with the entries in
the hash table, the entry point may simply create a 'struct
bfd_link_hash_table'.  Most likely, however, some additional information
will be needed.

   For example, with each entry in the hash table the a.out linker keeps
the index the symbol has in the final output file (this index number is
used so that when doing a relocatable link the symbol index used in the
output file can be quickly filled in when copying over a reloc).  The
a.out linker code defines the required structures and functions for a
hash table derived from 'struct bfd_link_hash_table'.  The a.out linker
hash table is created by the function
'NAME(aout,link_hash_table_create)'; it simply allocates space for the
hash table, initializes it, and returns a pointer to it.

   When writing the linker routines for a new back end, you will
generally not know exactly which fields will be required until you have
finished.  You should simply create a new hash table which defines no
additional fields, and then simply add fields as they become necessary.

2.17.2 Adding symbols to the hash table
---------------------------------------

The linker proper will call the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point for
each object file or archive which is to be linked (typically these are
the files named on the command line, but some may also come from the
linker script).  The entry point is responsible for examining the file.
For an object file, BFD must add any relevant symbol information to the
hash table.  For an archive, BFD must determine which elements of the
archive should be used and adding them to the link.

   The a.out version of this entry point is
'NAME(aout,link_add_symbols)'.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Differing file formats,  Next: Adding symbols from an object file,  Prev: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.17.2.1 Differing file formats
...............................

Normally all the files involved in a link will be of the same format,
but it is also possible to link together different format object files,
and the back end must support that.  The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry
point is called via the target vector of the file to be added.  This has
an important consequence: the function may not assume that the hash
table is the type created by the corresponding
'_bfd_link_hash_table_create' vector.  All the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function can assume about the hash table is that it is derived from
'struct bfd_link_hash_table'.

   Sometimes the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function must store some
information in the hash table entry to be used by the '_bfd_final_link'
function.  In such a case the output bfd xvec must be checked to make
sure that the hash table was created by an object file of the same
format.

   The '_bfd_final_link' routine must be prepared to handle a hash entry
without any extra information added by the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function.  A hash entry without extra information will also occur when
the linker script directs the linker to create a symbol.  Note that,
regardless of how a hash table entry is added, all the fields will be
initialized to some sort of null value by the hash table entry
initialization function.

   See 'ecoff_link_add_externals' for an example of how to check the
output bfd before saving information (in this case, the ECOFF external
symbol debugging information) in a hash table entry.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Adding symbols from an object file,  Next: Adding symbols from an archive,  Prev: Differing file formats,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.17.2.2 Adding symbols from an object file
...........................................

When the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an object file, it
must add all externally visible symbols in that object file to the hash
table.  The actual work of adding the symbol to the hash table is
normally handled by the function '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.
The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is responsible for reading all the
symbols from the object file and passing the correct information to
'_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.

   The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should not use
'bfd_canonicalize_symtab' to read the symbols.  The point of providing
this routine is to avoid the overhead of converting the symbols into
generic 'asymbol' structures.

   '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' handles the details of combining
common symbols, warning about multiple definitions, and so forth.  It
takes arguments which describe the symbol to add, notably symbol flags,
a section, and an offset.  The symbol flags include such things as
'BSF_WEAK' or 'BSF_INDIRECT'.  The section is a section in the object
file, or something like 'bfd_und_section_ptr' for an undefined symbol or
'bfd_com_section_ptr' for a common symbol.

   If the '_bfd_final_link' routine is also going to need to read the
symbol information, the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should save it
somewhere attached to the object file BFD. However, the information
should only be saved if the 'keep_memory' field of the 'info' argument
is TRUE, so that the '-no-keep-memory' linker switch is effective.

   The a.out function which adds symbols from an object file is
'aout_link_add_object_symbols', and most of the interesting work is in
'aout_link_add_symbols'.  The latter saves pointers to the hash tables
entries created by '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' indexed by symbol
number, so that the '_bfd_final_link' routine does not have to call the
hash table lookup routine to locate the entry.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Adding symbols from an archive,  Prev: Adding symbols from an object file,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.17.2.3 Adding symbols from an archive
.......................................

When the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an archive, it must
look through the symbols defined by the archive and decide which
elements of the archive should be included in the link.  For each such
element it must call the 'add_archive_element' linker callback, and it
must add the symbols from the object file to the linker hash table.
(The callback may in fact indicate that a replacement BFD should be
used, in which case the symbols from that BFD should be added to the
linker hash table instead.)

   In most cases the work of looking through the symbols in the archive
should be done by the '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' function.
'_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' is passed a function to call to
make the final decision about adding an archive element to the link and
to do the actual work of adding the symbols to the linker hash table.
If the element is to be included, the 'add_archive_element' linker
callback routine must be called with the element as an argument, and the
element's symbols must be added to the linker hash table just as though
the element had itself been passed to the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function.

   When the a.out '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function receives an archive,
it calls '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' passing
'aout_link_check_archive_element' as the function argument.
'aout_link_check_archive_element' calls 'aout_link_check_ar_symbols'.
If the latter decides to add the element (an element is only added if it
provides a real, non-common, definition for a previously undefined or
common symbol) it calls the 'add_archive_element' callback and then
'aout_link_check_archive_element' calls 'aout_link_add_symbols' to
actually add the symbols to the linker hash table - possibly those of a
substitute BFD, if the 'add_archive_element' callback avails itself of
that option.

   The ECOFF back end is unusual in that it does not normally call
'_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols', because ECOFF archives already
contain a hash table of symbols.  The ECOFF back end searches the
archive itself to avoid the overhead of creating a new hash table.

2.17.3 Performing the final link
--------------------------------

When all the input files have been processed, the linker calls the
'_bfd_final_link' entry point of the output BFD. This routine is
responsible for producing the final output file, which has several
aspects.  It must relocate the contents of the input sections and copy
the data into the output sections.  It must build an output symbol table
including any local symbols from the input files and the global symbols
from the hash table.  When producing relocatable output, it must modify
the input relocs and write them into the output file.  There may also be
object format dependent work to be done.

   The linker will also call the 'write_object_contents' entry point
when the BFD is closed.  The two entry points must work together in
order to produce the correct output file.

   The details of how this works are inevitably dependent upon the
specific object file format.  The a.out '_bfd_final_link' routine is
'NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.17.3.1 Information provided by the linker
...........................................

Before the linker calls the '_bfd_final_link' entry point, it sets up
some data structures for the function to use.

   The 'input_bfds' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure will point to
a list of all the input files included in the link.  These files are
linked through the 'link.next' field of the 'bfd' structure.

   Each section in the output file will have a list of 'link_order'
structures attached to the 'map_head.link_order' field (the 'link_order'
structure is defined in 'bfdlink.h').  These structures describe how to
create the contents of the output section in terms of the contents of
various input sections, fill constants, and, eventually, other types of
information.  They also describe relocs that must be created by the BFD
backend, but do not correspond to any input file; this is used to
support -Ur, which builds constructors while generating a relocatable
object file.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Relocating the section contents,  Next: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Information provided by the linker,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.17.3.2 Relocating the section contents
........................................

The '_bfd_final_link' function should look through the 'link_order'
structures attached to each section of the output file.  Each
'link_order' structure should either be handled specially, or it should
be passed to the function '_bfd_default_link_order' which will do the
right thing ('_bfd_default_link_order' is defined in 'linker.c').

   For efficiency, a 'link_order' of type 'bfd_indirect_link_order'
whose associated section belongs to a BFD of the same format as the
output BFD must be handled specially.  This type of 'link_order'
describes part of an output section in terms of a section belonging to
one of the input files.  The '_bfd_final_link' function should read the
contents of the section and any associated relocs, apply the relocs to
the section contents, and write out the modified section contents.  If
performing a relocatable link, the relocs themselves must also be
modified and written out.

   The functions '_bfd_relocate_contents' and '_bfd_final_link_relocate'
provide some general support for performing the actual relocations,
notably overflow checking.  Their arguments include information about
the symbol the relocation is against and a 'reloc_howto_type' argument
which describes the relocation to perform.  These functions are defined
in 'reloc.c'.

   The a.out function which handles reading, relocating, and writing
section contents is 'aout_link_input_section'.  The actual relocation is
done in 'aout_link_input_section_std' and 'aout_link_input_section_ext'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Relocating the section contents,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.17.3.3 Writing the symbol table
.................................

The '_bfd_final_link' function must gather all the symbols in the input
files and write them out.  It must also write out all the symbols in the
global hash table.  This must be controlled by the 'strip' and 'discard'
fields of the 'bfd_link_info' structure.

   The local symbols of the input files will not have been entered into
the linker hash table.  The '_bfd_final_link' routine must consider each
input file and include the symbols in the output file.  It may be
convenient to do this when looking through the 'link_order' structures,
or it may be done by stepping through the 'input_bfds' list.

   The '_bfd_final_link' routine must also traverse the global hash
table to gather all the externally visible symbols.  It is possible that
most of the externally visible symbols may be written out when
considering the symbols of each input file, but it is still necessary to
traverse the hash table since the linker script may have defined some
symbols that are not in any of the input files.

   The 'strip' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure controls which
symbols are written out.  The possible values are listed in 'bfdlink.h'.
If the value is 'strip_some', then the 'keep_hash' field of the
'bfd_link_info' structure is a hash table of symbols to keep; each
symbol should be looked up in this hash table, and only symbols which
are present should be included in the output file.

   If the 'strip' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure permits local
symbols to be written out, the 'discard' field is used to further
controls which local symbols are included in the output file.  If the
value is 'discard_l', then all local symbols which begin with a certain
prefix are discarded; this is controlled by the
'bfd_is_local_label_name' entry point.

   The a.out backend handles symbols by calling
'aout_link_write_symbols' on each input BFD and then traversing the
global hash table with the function 'aout_link_write_other_symbol'.  It
builds a string table while writing out the symbols, which is written to
the output file at the end of 'NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.18 Hash Tables
================

BFD provides a simple set of hash table functions.  Routines are
provided to initialize a hash table, to free a hash table, to look up a
string in a hash table and optionally create an entry for it, and to
traverse a hash table.  There is currently no routine to delete an
string from a hash table.

   The basic hash table does not permit any data to be stored with a
string.  However, a hash table is designed to present a base class from
which other types of hash tables may be derived.  These derived types
may store additional information with the string.  Hash tables were
implemented in this way, rather than simply providing a data pointer in
a hash table entry, because they were designed for use by the linker
back ends.  The linker may create thousands of hash table entries, and
the overhead of allocating private data and storing and following
pointers becomes noticeable.

   The basic hash table code is in 'hash.c'.

2.18.1 Creating and freeing a hash table
----------------------------------------

To create a hash table, create an instance of a 'struct bfd_hash_table'
(defined in 'bfd.h') and call 'bfd_hash_table_init' (if you know
approximately how many entries you will need, the function
'bfd_hash_table_init_n', which takes a SIZE argument, may be used).
'bfd_hash_table_init' returns 'FALSE' if some sort of error occurs.

   The function 'bfd_hash_table_init' take as an argument a function to
use to create new entries.  For a basic hash table, use the function
'bfd_hash_newfunc'.  *Note Deriving a New Hash Table Type::, for why you
would want to use a different value for this argument.

   'bfd_hash_table_init' will create an objalloc which will be used to
allocate new entries.  You may allocate memory on this objalloc using
'bfd_hash_allocate'.

   Use 'bfd_hash_table_free' to free up all the memory that has been
allocated for a hash table.  This will not free up the 'struct
bfd_hash_table' itself, which you must provide.

   Use 'bfd_hash_set_default_size' to set the default size of hash table
to use.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Next: Traversing a Hash Table,  Prev: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.2 Looking up or entering a string
--------------------------------------

The function 'bfd_hash_lookup' is used both to look up a string in the
hash table and to create a new entry.

   If the CREATE argument is 'FALSE', 'bfd_hash_lookup' will look up a
string.  If the string is found, it will returns a pointer to a 'struct
bfd_hash_entry'.  If the string is not found in the table
'bfd_hash_lookup' will return 'NULL'.  You should not modify any of the
fields in the returns 'struct bfd_hash_entry'.

   If the CREATE argument is 'TRUE', the string will be entered into the
hash table if it is not already there.  Either way a pointer to a
'struct bfd_hash_entry' will be returned, either to the existing
structure or to a newly created one.  In this case, a 'NULL' return
means that an error occurred.

   If the CREATE argument is 'TRUE', and a new entry is created, the
COPY argument is used to decide whether to copy the string onto the hash
table objalloc or not.  If COPY is passed as 'FALSE', you must be
careful not to deallocate or modify the string as long as the hash table
exists.

2.18.3 Traversing a hash table
------------------------------

The function 'bfd_hash_traverse' may be used to traverse a hash table,
calling a function on each element.  The traversal is done in a random
order.

   'bfd_hash_traverse' takes as arguments a function and a generic 'void
*' pointer.  The function is called with a hash table entry (a 'struct
bfd_hash_entry *') and the generic pointer passed to
'bfd_hash_traverse'.  The function must return a 'boolean' value, which
indicates whether to continue traversing the hash table.  If the
function returns 'FALSE', 'bfd_hash_traverse' will stop the traversal
and return immediately.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Prev: Traversing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.4 Deriving a new hash table type
-------------------------------------

Many uses of hash tables want to store additional information which each
entry in the hash table.  Some also find it convenient to store
additional information with the hash table itself.  This may be done
using a derived hash table.

   Since C is not an object oriented language, creating a derived hash
table requires sticking together some boilerplate routines with a few
differences specific to the type of hash table you want to create.

   An example of a derived hash table is the linker hash table.  The
structures for this are defined in 'bfdlink.h'.  The functions are in
'linker.c'.

   You may also derive a hash table from an already derived hash table.
For example, the a.out linker backend code uses a hash table derived
from the linker hash table.

2.18.4.1 Define the derived structures
......................................

You must define a structure for an entry in the hash table, and a
structure for the hash table itself.

   The first field in the structure for an entry in the hash table must
be of the type used for an entry in the hash table you are deriving
from.  If you are deriving from a basic hash table this is 'struct
bfd_hash_entry', which is defined in 'bfd.h'.  The first field in the
structure for the hash table itself must be of the type of the hash
table you are deriving from itself.  If you are deriving from a basic
hash table, this is 'struct bfd_hash_table'.

   For example, the linker hash table defines 'struct
bfd_link_hash_entry' (in 'bfdlink.h').  The first field, 'root', is of
type 'struct bfd_hash_entry'.  Similarly, the first field in 'struct
bfd_link_hash_table', 'table', is of type 'struct bfd_hash_table'.

2.18.4.2 Write the derived creation routine
...........................................

You must write a routine which will create and initialize an entry in
the hash table.  This routine is passed as the function argument to
'bfd_hash_table_init'.

   In order to permit other hash tables to be derived from the hash
table you are creating, this routine must be written in a standard way.

   The first argument to the creation routine is a pointer to a hash
table entry.  This may be 'NULL', in which case the routine should
allocate the right amount of space.  Otherwise the space has already
been allocated by a hash table type derived from this one.

   After allocating space, the creation routine must call the creation
routine of the hash table type it is derived from, passing in a pointer
to the space it just allocated.  This will initialize any fields used by
the base hash table.

   Finally the creation routine must initialize any local fields for the
new hash table type.

   Here is a boilerplate example of a creation routine.  FUNCTION_NAME
is the name of the routine.  ENTRY_TYPE is the type of an entry in the
hash table you are creating.  BASE_NEWFUNC is the name of the creation
routine of the hash table type your hash table is derived from.

     struct bfd_hash_entry *
     FUNCTION_NAME (struct bfd_hash_entry *entry,
                          struct bfd_hash_table *table,
                          const char *string)
     {
       struct ENTRY_TYPE *ret = (ENTRY_TYPE *) entry;

      /* Allocate the structure if it has not already been allocated by a
         derived class.  */
       if (ret == NULL)
         {
           ret = bfd_hash_allocate (table, sizeof (* ret));
           if (ret == NULL)
             return NULL;
         }

      /* Call the allocation method of the base class.  */
       ret = ((ENTRY_TYPE *)
             BASE_NEWFUNC ((struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret, table, string));

      /* Initialize the local fields here.  */

       return (struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret;
     }
   *Description*
The creation routine for the linker hash table, which is in 'linker.c',
looks just like this example.  FUNCTION_NAME is
'_bfd_link_hash_newfunc'.  ENTRY_TYPE is 'struct bfd_link_hash_entry'.
BASE_NEWFUNC is 'bfd_hash_newfunc', the creation routine for a basic
hash table.

   '_bfd_link_hash_newfunc' also initializes the local fields in a
linker hash table entry: 'type', 'written' and 'next'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.3 Write other derived routines
.....................................

You will want to write other routines for your new hash table, as well.

   You will want an initialization routine which calls the
initialization routine of the hash table you are deriving from and
initializes any other local fields.  For the linker hash table, this is
'_bfd_link_hash_table_init' in 'linker.c'.

   You will want a lookup routine which calls the lookup routine of the
hash table you are deriving from and casts the result.  The linker hash
table uses 'bfd_link_hash_lookup' in 'linker.c' (this actually takes an
additional argument which it uses to decide how to return the looked up
value).

   You may want a traversal routine.  This should just call the
traversal routine of the hash table you are deriving from with
appropriate casts.  The linker hash table uses 'bfd_link_hash_traverse'
in 'linker.c'.

   These routines may simply be defined as macros.  For example, the
a.out backend linker hash table, which is derived from the linker hash
table, uses macros for the lookup and traversal routines.  These are
'aout_link_hash_lookup' and 'aout_link_hash_traverse' in aoutx.h.

3.1 What to Put Where
=====================

All of BFD lives in one directory.


File: bfd.info,  Node: aout,  Next: coff,  Prev: What to Put Where,  Up: BFD back ends

3.2 a.out backends
==================

*Description*
BFD supports a number of different flavours of a.out format, though the
major differences are only the sizes of the structures on disk, and the
shape of the relocation information.

   The support is split into a basic support file 'aoutx.h' and other
files which derive functions from the base.  One derivation file is
'aoutf1.h' (for a.out flavour 1), and adds to the basic a.out functions
support for sun3, sun4, 386 and 29k a.out files, to create a target jump
vector for a specific target.

   This information is further split out into more specific files for
each machine, including 'sunos.c' for sun3 and sun4, 'newsos3.c' for the
Sony NEWS, and 'demo64.c' for a demonstration of a 64 bit a.out format.

   The base file 'aoutx.h' defines general mechanisms for reading and
writing records to and from disk and various other methods which BFD
requires.  It is included by 'aout32.c' and 'aout64.c' to form the names
'aout_32_swap_exec_header_in', 'aout_64_swap_exec_header_in', etc.

   As an example, this is what goes on to make the back end for a sun4,
from 'aout32.c':

            #define ARCH_SIZE 32
            #include "aoutx.h"

   Which exports names:

            ...
            aout_32_canonicalize_reloc
            aout_32_find_nearest_line
            aout_32_get_lineno
            aout_32_get_reloc_upper_bound
            ...

   from 'sunos.c':

            #define TARGET_NAME "a.out-sunos-big"
            #define VECNAME    sparc_aout_sunos_be_vec
            #include "aoutf1.h"

   requires all the names from 'aout32.c', and produces the jump vector

            sparc_aout_sunos_be_vec

   The file 'host-aout.c' is a special case.  It is for a large set of
hosts that use "more or less standard" a.out files, and for which
cross-debugging is not interesting.  It uses the standard 32-bit a.out
support routines, but determines the file offsets and addresses of the
text, data, and BSS sections, the machine architecture and machine type,
and the entry point address, in a host-dependent manner.  Once these
values have been determined, generic code is used to handle the object
file.

   When porting it to run on a new system, you must supply:

             HOST_PAGE_SIZE
             HOST_SEGMENT_SIZE
             HOST_MACHINE_ARCH       (optional)
             HOST_MACHINE_MACHINE    (optional)
             HOST_TEXT_START_ADDR
             HOST_STACK_END_ADDR

   in the file '../include/sys/h-XXX.h' (for your host).  These values,
plus the structures and macros defined in 'a.out.h' on your host system,
will produce a BFD target that will access ordinary a.out files on your
host.  To configure a new machine to use 'host-aout.c', specify:

            TDEFAULTS = -DDEFAULT_VECTOR=host_aout_big_vec
            TDEPFILES= host-aout.o trad-core.o

   in the 'config/XXX.mt' file, and modify 'configure.ac' to use the
'XXX.mt' file (by setting "'bfd_target=XXX'") when your configuration is
selected.

3.2.1 Relocations
-----------------

*Description*
The file 'aoutx.h' provides for both the _standard_ and _extended_ forms
of a.out relocation records.

   The standard records contain only an address, a symbol index, and a
type field.  The extended records (used on 29ks and sparcs) also have a
full integer for an addend.

3.2.2 Internal entry points
---------------------------

*Description*
'aoutx.h' exports several routines for accessing the contents of an
a.out file, which are gathered and exported in turn by various format
specific files (eg sunos.c).

3.3 coff backends
=================

BFD supports a number of different flavours of coff format.  The major
differences between formats are the sizes and alignments of fields in
structures on disk, and the occasional extra field.

   Coff in all its varieties is implemented with a few common files and
a number of implementation specific files.  For example, The 88k bcs
coff format is implemented in the file 'coff-m88k.c'.  This file
'#include's 'coff/m88k.h' which defines the external structure of the
coff format for the 88k, and 'coff/internal.h' which defines the
internal structure.  'coff-m88k.c' also defines the relocations used by
the 88k format *Note Relocations::.

   The Intel i960 processor version of coff is implemented in
'coff-i960.c'.  This file has the same structure as 'coff-m88k.c',
except that it includes 'coff/i960.h' rather than 'coff-m88k.h'.

3.3.1 Porting to a new version of coff
--------------------------------------

The recommended method is to select from the existing implementations
the version of coff which is most like the one you want to use.  For
example, we'll say that i386 coff is the one you select, and that your
coff flavour is called foo.  Copy 'i386coff.c' to 'foocoff.c', copy
'../include/coff/i386.h' to '../include/coff/foo.h', and add the lines
to 'targets.c' and 'Makefile.in' so that your new back end is used.
Alter the shapes of the structures in '../include/coff/foo.h' so that
they match what you need.  You will probably also have to add '#ifdef's
to the code in 'coff/internal.h' and 'coffcode.h' if your version of
coff is too wild.

   You can verify that your new BFD backend works quite simply by
building 'objdump' from the 'binutils' directory, and making sure that
its version of what's going on and your host system's idea (assuming it
has the pretty standard coff dump utility, usually called 'att-dump' or
just 'dump') are the same.  Then clean up your code, and send what
you've done to Cygnus.  Then your stuff will be in the next release, and
you won't have to keep integrating it.

3.3.2 How the coff backend works
--------------------------------

3.3.2.1 File layout
...................

The Coff backend is split into generic routines that are applicable to
any Coff target and routines that are specific to a particular target.
The target-specific routines are further split into ones which are
basically the same for all Coff targets except that they use the
external symbol format or use different values for certain constants.

   The generic routines are in 'coffgen.c'.  These routines work for any
Coff target.  They use some hooks into the target specific code; the
hooks are in a 'bfd_coff_backend_data' structure, one of which exists
for each target.

   The essentially similar target-specific routines are in 'coffcode.h'.
This header file includes executable C code.  The various Coff targets
first include the appropriate Coff header file, make any special defines
that are needed, and then include 'coffcode.h'.

   Some of the Coff targets then also have additional routines in the
target source file itself.

   For example, 'coff-i960.c' includes 'coff/internal.h' and
'coff/i960.h'.  It then defines a few constants, such as 'I960', and
includes 'coffcode.h'.  Since the i960 has complex relocation types,
'coff-i960.c' also includes some code to manipulate the i960 relocs.
This code is not in 'coffcode.h' because it would not be used by any
other target.

3.3.2.2 Coff long section names
...............................

In the standard Coff object format, section names are limited to the
eight bytes available in the 's_name' field of the 'SCNHDR' section
header structure.  The format requires the field to be NUL-padded, but
not necessarily NUL-terminated, so the longest section names permitted
are a full eight characters.

   The Microsoft PE variants of the Coff object file format add an
extension to support the use of long section names.  This extension is
defined in section 4 of the Microsoft PE/COFF specification (rev 8.1).
If a section name is too long to fit into the section header's 's_name'
field, it is instead placed into the string table, and the 's_name'
field is filled with a slash ("/") followed by the ASCII decimal
representation of the offset of the full name relative to the string
table base.

   Note that this implies that the extension can only be used in object
files, as executables do not contain a string table.  The standard
specifies that long section names from objects emitted into executable
images are to be truncated.

   However, as a GNU extension, BFD can generate executable images that
contain a string table and long section names.  This would appear to be
technically valid, as the standard only says that Coff debugging
information is deprecated, not forbidden, and in practice it works,
although some tools that parse PE files expecting the MS standard format
may become confused; 'PEview' is one known example.

   The functionality is supported in BFD by code implemented under the
control of the macro 'COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES'.  If not defined, the
format does not support long section names in any way.  If defined, it
is used to initialise a flag, '_bfd_coff_long_section_names', and a hook
function pointer, '_bfd_coff_set_long_section_names', in the Coff
backend data structure.  The flag controls the generation of long
section names in output BFDs at runtime; if it is false, as it will be
by default when generating an executable image, long section names are
truncated; if true, the long section names extension is employed.  The
hook points to a function that allows the value of the flag to be
altered at runtime, on formats that support long section names at all;
on other formats it points to a stub that returns an error indication.

   With input BFDs, the flag is set according to whether any long
section names are detected while reading the section headers.  For a
completely new BFD, the flag is set to the default for the target
format.  This information can be used by a client of the BFD library
when deciding what output format to generate, and means that a BFD that
is opened for read and subsequently converted to a writeable BFD and
modified in-place will retain whatever format it had on input.

   If 'COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES' is simply defined (blank), or is defined
to the value "1", then long section names are enabled by default; if it
is defined to the value zero, they are disabled by default (but still
accepted in input BFDs).  The header 'coffcode.h' defines a macro,
'COFF_DEFAULT_LONG_SECTION_NAMES', which is used in the backends to
initialise the backend data structure fields appropriately; see the
comments for further detail.

3.3.2.3 Bit twiddling
.....................

Each flavour of coff supported in BFD has its own header file describing
the external layout of the structures.  There is also an internal
description of the coff layout, in 'coff/internal.h'.  A major function
of the coff backend is swapping the bytes and twiddling the bits to
translate the external form of the structures into the normal internal
form.  This is all performed in the 'bfd_swap'_thing_direction routines.
Some elements are different sizes between different versions of coff; it
is the duty of the coff version specific include file to override the
definitions of various packing routines in 'coffcode.h'.  E.g., the size
of line number entry in coff is sometimes 16 bits, and sometimes 32
bits.  '#define'ing 'PUT_LNSZ_LNNO' and 'GET_LNSZ_LNNO' will select the
correct one.  No doubt, some day someone will find a version of coff
which has a varying field size not catered to at the moment.  To port
BFD, that person will have to add more '#defines'.  Three of the bit
twiddling routines are exported to 'gdb'; 'coff_swap_aux_in',
'coff_swap_sym_in' and 'coff_swap_lineno_in'.  'GDB' reads the symbol
table on its own, but uses BFD to fix things up.  More of the bit
twiddlers are exported for 'gas'; 'coff_swap_aux_out',
'coff_swap_sym_out', 'coff_swap_lineno_out', 'coff_swap_reloc_out',
'coff_swap_filehdr_out', 'coff_swap_aouthdr_out',
'coff_swap_scnhdr_out'.  'Gas' currently keeps track of all the symbol
table and reloc drudgery itself, thereby saving the internal BFD
overhead, but uses BFD to swap things on the way out, making cross ports
much safer.  Doing so also allows BFD (and thus the linker) to use the
same header files as 'gas', which makes one avenue to disaster
disappear.

3.3.2.4 Symbol reading
......................

The simple canonical form for symbols used by BFD is not rich enough to
keep all the information available in a coff symbol table.  The back end
gets around this problem by keeping the original symbol table around,
"behind the scenes".

   When a symbol table is requested (through a call to
'bfd_canonicalize_symtab'), a request gets through to
'coff_get_normalized_symtab'.  This reads the symbol table from the coff
file and swaps all the structures inside into the internal form.  It
also fixes up all the pointers in the table (represented in the file by
offsets from the first symbol in the table) into physical pointers to
elements in the new internal table.  This involves some work since the
meanings of fields change depending upon context: a field that is a
pointer to another structure in the symbol table at one moment may be
the size in bytes of a structure at the next.  Another pass is made over
the table.  All symbols which mark file names ('C_FILE' symbols) are
modified so that the internal string points to the value in the auxent
(the real filename) rather than the normal text associated with the
symbol ('".file"').

   At this time the symbol names are moved around.  Coff stores all
symbols less than nine characters long physically within the symbol
table; longer strings are kept at the end of the file in the string
table.  This pass moves all strings into memory and replaces them with
pointers to the strings.

   The symbol table is massaged once again, this time to create the
canonical table used by the BFD application.  Each symbol is inspected
in turn, and a decision made (using the 'sclass' field) about the
various flags to set in the 'asymbol'.  *Note Symbols::.  The generated
canonical table shares strings with the hidden internal symbol table.

   Any linenumbers are read from the coff file too, and attached to the
symbols which own the functions the linenumbers belong to.

3.3.2.5 Symbol writing
......................

Writing a symbol to a coff file which didn't come from a coff file will
lose any debugging information.  The 'asymbol' structure remembers the
BFD from which the symbol was taken, and on output the back end makes
sure that the same destination target as source target is present.

   When the symbols have come from a coff file then all the debugging
information is preserved.

   Symbol tables are provided for writing to the back end in a vector of
pointers to pointers.  This allows applications like the linker to
accumulate and output large symbol tables without having to do too much
byte copying.

   This function runs through the provided symbol table and patches each
symbol marked as a file place holder ('C_FILE') to point to the next
file place holder in the list.  It also marks each 'offset' field in the
list with the offset from the first symbol of the current symbol.

   Another function of this procedure is to turn the canonical value
form of BFD into the form used by coff.  Internally, BFD expects symbol
values to be offsets from a section base; so a symbol physically at
0x120, but in a section starting at 0x100, would have the value 0x20.
Coff expects symbols to contain their final value, so symbols have their
values changed at this point to reflect their sum with their owning
section.  This transformation uses the 'output_section' field of the
'asymbol''s 'asection' *Note Sections::.

   * 'coff_mangle_symbols'
   This routine runs though the provided symbol table and uses the
offsets generated by the previous pass and the pointers generated when
the symbol table was read in to create the structured hierarchy required
by coff.  It changes each pointer to a symbol into the index into the
symbol table of the asymbol.

   * 'coff_write_symbols'
   This routine runs through the symbol table and patches up the symbols
from their internal form into the coff way, calls the bit twiddlers, and
writes out the table to the file.

3.3.2.6 'coff_symbol_type'

3.3.2.8 Writing relocations
...........................

To write relocations, the back end steps though the canonical relocation
table and create an 'internal_reloc'.  The symbol index to use is
removed from the 'offset' field in the symbol table supplied.  The
address comes directly from the sum of the section base address and the
relocation offset; the type is dug directly from the howto field.  Then
the 'internal_reloc' is swapped into the shape of an 'external_reloc'
and written out to disk.

3.3.2.9 Reading linenumbers
...........................

Creating the linenumber table is done by reading in the entire coff
linenumber table, and creating another table for internal use.

   A coff linenumber table is structured so that each function is marked
as having a line number of 0.  Each line within the function is an
offset from the first line in the function.  The base of the line number
information for the table is stored in the symbol associated with the
function.

   Note: The PE format uses line number 0 for a flag indicating a new
source file.

   The information is copied from the external to the internal table,
and each symbol which marks a function is marked by pointing its...

   How does this work ?

3.3.2.10 Reading relocations
............................

Coff relocations are easily transformed into the internal BFD form
('arelent').

   Reading a coff relocation table is done in the following stages:

   * Read the entire coff relocation table into memory.

   * Process each relocation in turn; first swap it from the external to
     the internal form.

   * Turn the symbol referenced in the relocation's symbol index into a
     pointer into the canonical symbol table.  This table is the same as
     the one returned by a call to 'bfd_canonicalize_symtab'.  The back
     end will call that routine and save the result if a
     canonicalization hasn't been done.

   * The reloc index is turned into a pointer to a howto structure, in a
     back end specific way.  For instance, the 386 and 960 use the
     'r_type' to directly produce an index into a howto table vector;
     the 88k subtracts a number from the 'r_type' field and creates an
     addend field.

3.4 ELF backends
================

BFD support for ELF formats is being worked on.  Currently, the best
supported back ends are for sparc and i386 (running svr4 or Solaris 2).

   Documentation of the internals of the support code still needs to be
written.  The code is changing quickly enough that we haven't bothered
yet.

3.5 mmo backend
===============

The mmo object format is used exclusively together with Professor Donald
E. Knuth's educational 64-bit processor MMIX. The simulator 'mmix' which
is available at <http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/src/index.html> understands this
format.  That package also includes a combined assembler and linker
called 'mmixal'.  The mmo format has no advantages feature-wise compared
to e.g.  ELF. It is a simple non-relocatable object format with no
support for archives or debugging information, except for symbol value
information and line numbers (which is not yet implemented in BFD). See
<http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/> for more information about MMIX. The ELF format
is used for intermediate object files in the BFD implementation.

File: bfd.info,  Node: File layout,  Next: Symbol-table,  Prev: mmo,  Up: mmo

3.5.1 File layout
-----------------

The mmo file contents is not partitioned into named sections as with
e.g. ELF. Memory areas is formed by specifying the location of the data
that follows.  Only the memory area '0x0000...00' to '0x01ff...ff' is
executable, so it is used for code (and constants) and the area
'0x2000...00' to '0x20ff...ff' is used for writable data.  *Note mmo
section mapping::.

   There is provision for specifying "special data" of 65536 different
types.  We use type 80 (decimal), arbitrarily chosen the same as the ELF
'e_machine' number for MMIX, filling it with section information
normally found in ELF objects.  *Note mmo section mapping::.

   Contents is entered as 32-bit words, xor:ed over previous contents,
always zero-initialized.  A word that starts with the byte '0x98' forms
a command called a 'lopcode', where the next byte distinguished between
the thirteen lopcodes.  The two remaining bytes, called the 'Y' and 'Z'
fields, or the 'YZ' field (a 16-bit big-endian number), are used for
various purposes different for each lopcode.  As documented in
<http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/mmixal.pdf>, the lopcodes are:

'lop_quote'
     0x98000001.  The next word is contents, regardless of whether it
     starts with 0x98 or not.

'lop_loc'
     0x9801YYZZ, where 'Z' is 1 or 2.  This is a location directive,
     setting the location for the next data to the next 32-bit word (for
     Z = 1) or 64-bit word (for Z = 2), plus Y * 2^56.  Normally 'Y' is
     0 for the text segment and 2 for the data segment.  Beware that the
     low bits of non- tetrabyte-aligned values are silently discarded
     when being automatically incremented and when storing contents (in
     contrast to e.g.  its use as current location when followed by
     lop_fixo et al before the next possibly-quoted tetrabyte contents).

'lop_skip'
     0x9802YYZZ. Increase the current location by 'YZ' bytes.

'lop_fixo'
     0x9803YYZZ, where 'Z' is 1 or 2.  Store the current location as 64
     bits into the location pointed to by the next 32-bit (Z = 1) or
     64-bit (Z = 2) word, plus Y * 2^56.

'lop_fixr'
     0x9804YYZZ. 'YZ' is stored into the current location plus 2 - 4 *
     YZ.

'lop_fixrx'
     0x980500ZZ. 'Z' is 16 or 24.  A value 'L' derived from the
     following 32-bit word are used in a manner similar to 'YZ' in
     lop_fixr: it is xor:ed into the current location minus 4 * L. The
     first byte of the word is 0 or 1.  If it is 1, then L = (LOWEST 24
     BITS OF WORD) - 2^Z, if 0, then L = (LOWEST 24 BITS OF WORD).

'lop_file'
     0x9806YYZZ. 'Y' is the file number, 'Z' is count of 32-bit words.
     Set the file number to 'Y' and the line counter to 0.  The next Z *
     4 bytes contain the file name, padded with zeros if the count is
     not a multiple of four.  The same 'Y' may occur multiple times, but
     'Z' must be 0 for all but the first occurrence.

'lop_line'
     0x9807YYZZ. 'YZ' is the line number.  Together with lop_file, it
     forms the source location for the next 32-bit word.  Note that for
     each non-lopcode 32-bit word, line numbers are assumed incremented
     by one.

'lop_spec'
     0x9808YYZZ. 'YZ' is the type number.  Data until the next lopcode
     other than lop_quote forms special data of type 'YZ'.  *Note mmo
     section mapping::.

     Other types than 80, (or type 80 with a content that does not
     parse) is stored in sections named '.MMIX.spec_data.N' where N is
     the 'YZ'-type.  The flags for such a sections say not to allocate
     or load the data.  The vma is 0.  Contents of multiple occurrences
     of special data N is concatenated to the data of the previous
     lop_spec Ns.  The location in data or code at which the lop_spec
     occurred is lost.

'lop_pre'
     0x980901ZZ. The first lopcode in a file.  The 'Z' field forms the
     length of header information in 32-bit words, where the first word
     tells the time in seconds since '00:00:00 GMT Jan 1 1970'.

'lop_post'
     0x980a00ZZ. Z > 32.  This lopcode follows after all
     content-generating lopcodes in a program.  The 'Z' field denotes
     the value of 'rG' at the beginning of the program.  The following
     256 - Z big-endian 64-bit words are loaded into global registers
     '$G' ... '$255'.

'lop_stab'
     0x980b0000.  The next-to-last lopcode in a program.  Must follow
     immediately after the lop_post lopcode and its data.  After this
     lopcode follows all symbols in a compressed format (*note
     Symbol-table::).

'lop_end'
     0x980cYYZZ. The last lopcode in a program.  It must follow the
     lop_stab lopcode and its data.  The 'YZ' field contains the number
     of 32-bit words of symbol table information after the preceding
     lop_stab lopcode.

   Note that the lopcode "fixups"; 'lop_fixr', 'lop_fixrx' and
'lop_fixo' are not generated by BFD, but are handled.  They are
generated by 'mmixal'.

   This trivial one-label, one-instruction file:

      :Main TRAP 1,2,3

   can be represented this way in mmo:

      0x98090101 - lop_pre, one 32-bit word with timestamp.
      <timestamp>
      0x98010002 - lop_loc, text segment, using a 64-bit address.
                   Note that mmixal does not emit this for the file above.
      0x00000000 - Address, high 32 bits.
      0x00000000 - Address, low 32 bits.
      0x98060002 - lop_file, 2 32-bit words for file-name.
      0x74657374 - "test"
      0x2e730000 - ".s\0\0"
      0x98070001 - lop_line, line 1.
      0x00010203 - TRAP 1,2,3
      0x980a00ff - lop_post, setting $255 to 0.
      0x00000000
      0x00000000
      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040   *Note Symbol-table::.
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000
      0x980c0005 - lop_end; symbol table contained five 32-bit words.

3.5.2 Symbol table format
-------------------------

From mmixal.w (or really, the generated mmixal.tex) in the MMIXware
package which also contains the 'mmix' simulator: "Symbols are stored
and retrieved by means of a 'ternary search trie', following ideas of
Bentley and Sedgewick.  (See ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms '8'
(1997), 360-369; R.Sedgewick, 'Algorithms in C' (Reading, Mass.
Addison-Wesley, 1998), '15.4'.)  Each trie node stores a character, and
there are branches to subtries for the cases where a given character is
less than, equal to, or greater than the character in the trie.  There
also is a pointer to a symbol table entry if a symbol ends at the
current node."

   So it's a tree encoded as a stream of bytes.  The stream of bytes
acts on a single virtual global symbol, adding and removing characters
and signalling complete symbol points.  Here, we read the stream and
create symbols at the completion points.

   First, there's a control byte 'm'.  If any of the listed bits in 'm'
is nonzero, we execute what stands at the right, in the listed order:

      (MMO3_LEFT)
      0x40 - Traverse left trie.
             (Read a new command byte and recurse.)

      (MMO3_SYMBITS)
      0x2f - Read the next byte as a character and store it in the
             current character position; increment character position.
             Test the bits of m:

             (MMO3_WCHAR)
             0x80 - The character is 16-bit (so read another byte,
                    merge into current character.

             (MMO3_TYPEBITS)
             0xf  - We have a complete symbol; parse the type, value
                    and serial number and do what should be done
                    with a symbol.  The type and length information
                    is in j = (m & 0xf).

                    (MMO3_REGQUAL_BITS)
                    j == 0xf: A register variable.  The following
                              byte tells which register.
                    j <= 8:   An absolute symbol.  Read j bytes as the
                              big-endian number the symbol equals.
                              A j = 2 with two zero bytes denotes an
                              unknown symbol.
                    j > 8:    As with j <= 8, but add (0x20 << 56)
                              to the value in the following j - 8
                              bytes.

                    Then comes the serial number, as a variant of
                    uleb128, but better named ubeb128:
                    Read bytes and shift the previous value left 7
                    (multiply by 128).  Add in the new byte, repeat
                    until a byte has bit 7 set.  The serial number
                    is the computed value minus 128.

             (MMO3_MIDDLE)
             0x20 - Traverse middle trie.  (Read a new command byte
                    and recurse.)  Decrement character position.

      (MMO3_RIGHT)
      0x10 - Traverse right trie.  (Read a new command byte and
             recurse.)

   Let's look again at the 'lop_stab' for the trivial file (*note File
layout::).

      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000

   This forms the trivial trie (note that the path between ":" and "M"
is redundant):

      203a     ":"
      40       /
      40      /
      10      \
      40      /
      40     /
      204d  "M"
      2061  "a"
      2069  "i"
      016e  "n" is the last character in a full symbol, and
            with a value represented in one byte.
      00    The value is 0.
      81    The serial number is 1.

3.5.3 mmo section mapping
-------------------------

The implementation in BFD uses special data type 80 (decimal) to
encapsulate and describe named sections, containing e.g. debug
information.  If needed, any datum in the encapsulation will be quoted
using lop_quote.  First comes a 32-bit word holding the number of 32-bit
words containing the zero-terminated zero-padded segment name.  After
the name there's a 32-bit word holding flags describing the section
type.  Then comes a 64-bit big-endian word with the section length (in
bytes), then another with the section start address.  Depending on the
type of section, the contents might follow, zero-padded to 32-bit
boundary.  For a loadable section (such as data or code), the contents
might follow at some later point, not necessarily immediately, as a
lop_loc with the same start address as in the section description,
followed by the contents.  This in effect forms a descriptor that must
be emitted before the actual contents.  Sections described this way must
not overlap.

   For areas that don't have such descriptors, synthetic sections are
formed by BFD. Consecutive contents in the two memory areas
'0x0000...00' to '0x01ff...ff' and '0x2000...00' to '0x20ff...ff' are
entered in sections named '.text' and '.data' respectively.  If an area
is not otherwise described, but would together with a neighboring lower
area be less than '0x40000000' bytes long, it is joined with the lower
area and the gap is zero-filled.  For other cases, a new section is
formed, named '.MMIX.sec.N'.  Here, N is a number, a running count
through the mmo file, starting at 0.

   A loadable section specified as:

      .section secname,"ax"
      TETRA 1,2,3,4,-1,-2009
      BYTE 80

   and linked to address '0x4', is represented by the sequence:

      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "secn"
      0x616d6500 - "ame\0"
      0x00000033 - flags CODE, READONLY, LOAD, ALLOC
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000001c - section length is 28 bytes; 6 * 4 + 1 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section address
      0x00000004 - section address is 4
      0x98010002 - 64 bits with address of following data
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x00000004 - low 32 bits: data starts at address 4
      0x00000001 - 1
      0x00000002 - 2
      0x00000003 - 3
      0x00000004 - 4
      0xffffffff - -1
      0xfffff827 - -2009
      0x50000000 - 80 as a byte, padded with zeros.

   Note that the lop_spec wrapping does not include the section
contents.  Compare this to a non-loaded section specified as:

      .section thirdsec
      TETRA 200001,100002
      BYTE 38,40

   This, when linked to address '0x200000000000001c', is represented by:

      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "thir"
      0x616d6500 - "dsec"
      0x00000010 - flag READONLY
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000000c - section length is 12 bytes; 2 * 4 + 2 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x20000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x0000001c - low 32 bits of address 0x200000000000001c
      0x00030d41 - 200001
      0x000186a2 - 100002
      0x26280000 - 38, 40 as bytes, padded with zeros

   For the latter example, the section contents must not be loaded in
memory, and is therefore specified as part of the special data.  The
address is usually unimportant but might provide information for e.g.
the DWARF 2 debugging format.

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
